Feature: Autocompletion of share-with names
  As a user
  I want to share files, with minimal typing, to the right people or groups
  So that I can efficiently share my files with other users or groups

  Background:
    # Users that are in the special known users already
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files but not initialized:
      | username    |
      | user1       |
      | regularuser |
    # Users that are in the special known users already without skeleton files
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | user3    |
      | usergrp  |
    # Some extra users without skeleton files to make the share autocompletion interesting
    And these users have been created without skeleton files:
      | username  | password  | displayname     | email          |
      | two       | %regular% | User Two        | u2@oc.com.np   |
      | u444      | %regular% | Four            | u3@oc.com.np   |
      | five      | %regular% | User Group      | five@oc.net.np |
      | usersmith | %regular% | John Finn Smith | js@oc.com.de   |
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname     |
      | finance1      |
      | finance2      |
      | finance3      |
      | users-finance |
      | other         |
